This blog post is about my CLI project, which I have basically just completed. I say *basically* because I have a *Minimum Viable Product* (or so it seems) and now that it's done, I have been adding more features. **It's addictive**!

This project was both absurdly difficult, and at the same time stunningly simple. As they say in the business (which business? I don't know): easy to say, hard to do!

One of my biggest recurring setbacks was losing my programmed code before I properly uploaded it to Github. Much of this heartache could have been solved by installing a local environment to my computer. 

So in this blog, I would like to explain what the Flatiron CLI project is, and some tips for doing it.

## What is the CLI project?

The CLI project is one of the first big milestones in Flatiron to assess your skills. 

Pretty much all the other lessons are reading, watching or coding with smaller bits of code within the contect of an entire program. 

By comparison to the earlier, this project is a test of personal project management skills. You have to manage yourself and manage your own learning. 

If you don't know something, you have to figure it out what you don't know, and then figure out how to aquire that skill. 

That means you'll have to reach out to instructor or fellow student and ask for assistance (people skills) or dig deep and learn it on your own (learning skills and/or coding skills)

## There are essentially three sections that make up this project: 

#### The first section is the CLI, the "Command Line Interface". 

This is what interfaces with humans and also where the logic of the program is. It asks the user something, it figures out what to do from the input, including calling upon other programs. 

#### The next section is the API, or perhaps the Scrapper section. 

This is the section that deals with the data on the outside, another computer program or a website.

A scrapper will pull data from a web page. This is done without the tacit approval of the webpage owner. It figuratively "scrapes" the data off a page or pages, making it the least consentual of either option.

By comparison, one could use an API, which stands for "Application Programming Interface" or some such WHATEVER. The point is that this is usually via a site, the owners of which WANT to share the data. 

The recommendation from the instructors was to go with the API (rather than a scrapper) for thee reasons:
1. We're likely to be using APIs for the forseable future in our careers.
2. Scrappers will likely increase the coding time on the project.
3. The point of the project is not to be the best scrapperer (or APIerer) in the world, but rather to make sure we have a firm understanding of a number of concepts, especially object oriented development.

#### The third section is the class that produces objects. 

As I mentioned before, a main point of the project is to understand how to deal with object oriented concepts. And although there are lots of ways to make this happen, the good folks at Flatiron want us to be able to know how to deal with objects.

Each of these should probably have it's own file. Beyond this, there are a number of ancillery files that make the project run. It's beyond the scope of this blog entry to get into the nitty gritty with those files, just know that this is a part of this as well.

## OK, now on to tips for the CLI project:

1. Allocate enough time. Better to over-allocate than under-allocate. 

2. This is the first self-directed project assigned and you should bring your best project management skills to the table. You also happen to be the front-line coder on this, so just make sure you're ready to work too.

3. Don't be afraid to reach out to people who can help. This could be your instructor, other students in your cohort, or other former and current students at Flatiron. At times it may feel like you're bugging people, but pretty much everyone was where you were at one point, so don't be afraid to reach out. The worst they can tell you is "no". I mean, I suppose the WORST they can tell you is that you are a horrible student and you will never amount to anything in life, but if they do that don't forget that sticks and stones can break your bones, but names will never hurt you.

4. Get a "Minimal Viable Product" done first. Make sure you get SOMEthing done, then you can add bells and whistles later. 

5. Make sure you do all the other things the project requires, including a README file, a video walk-through, a blog entry etc. Not only is all that stuff required, but it's good for you. 

6. Don't be afraid to re-learn concepts and re-look at lessons you though your learned before. 

This is a lifelong process, and just cause you looked at it once doesn't it mean it really sunk in. For me, I got an $11 Udemy course as a supplement for easy look up of video lessons on various concepts.

7. Don't beat yourself up. These are difficult-to-get concepts. Once you get them, they might seem obvious, but that's only because you spent the time studing and getting into them.

8. Install a local enviroment rather than using an IDE. I mentioned before I lost lots of data? If you do one thing wrong with the IDE, you could wipe everything away. Recommend going local.

9. Upload to Github as often as you can. Set a timer if you need to. 

10. Map out your logic (usually in the CLI file) if needed. If you see that you not understanding what things do when, you may need to take pen to paper and write out a map of what happens when. This should help you figure out logical problems and areas you can improve. 

#### Remember to savor the process during this process. If you determine that you don't know a concept, that's okay! Learn as you go: that's what it's all about!

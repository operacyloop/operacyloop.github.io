This is not a paid advertisement for the Flatiron School.  But it will be interesting to see how their graduate coders fare after they become "software engineers" in the real world. If the underlying philosophy of (and I am paraphrasing from memory) something like "find awesome people and teach them how to code" holds true, you're going to have well-grounded people, with a solid understanding of what the reasons users want to use software in the first place. 

**My Reason for Enrolling**

I decided to start this boot camp because of a couple of reasons, but one is because I wanted to build a software tool that can be used in the real world. I come to this with an understanding of what the end user needs in this tool (and why it would be invaluable), not trying to show off how my elegant or fancy my code is. In fact, I am willing to admit that it's likely my code will be lacking in a lot of ways, and I am also willing to get help from those who know more than me, as long as they understand that we're doing all of this for the user. It's also likely that although there are slight challenges in what I am trying to do, nothing will be earth-shattering in coding accomplishment. 

**Power Dynamic to Shift: Software Made to Align with Real World**
(Rather than the Other Way Around)

Another way of saying this is that this new breed of coder is interested in allowing software to attach itself to the real world as the real world would have it, rather than forcing the real world to adhere to its dictums. Up until now (but less and less so in some realms), software producers had the leverage and (dare I use this word?) *power* in the relationship between code and human. 

**An Example**

What's an example? Say some social network's relatively new insistence that users use their legal name, enforced by required submission of government-issued identification under certain circumstances. But not everyone goes by their legal name. Some people use nicknames and other handles. Some people have grown to dislike their birth name. 

Even famous people are not immune to software systems unfair power dynamic: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/salman-rushdie-battles-facebook-over-his-identity-flna119099

So that's the first part. In short, producing a class of sort of "non-coder coders" who understand the world from a users perspective. That all surrounds recruitment. Recruiting people that have a real and robust understanding of the world. 

**Cultivating Precise Thinking**

What's the second part to creating this new breed of coders? Cultivating in those people thinking that is precise enough to mirror the real world. This involves thinking in analogies: being able to think and understand how things *really* work, and how to translate that into a thought process that is both simple enough to be outlined with instructions, but nuanced enough to mimic to a close enough degree what is actually happening.

**The Only Way to Know For Sure**

If I am right, I think this new breed of coders will bring something to the table that maybe other generations of coders were missing. I paint with a *broad brush*, and I speak perhaps even in stereotypes. But I only know the software (and systems, which themselves are based on software) I am subjected to, and I think there is plenty of room for improvement. Maybe that's what we need: people entering the coding world, not just coming to the software engineering realm from a user's perspective, but actually holding the user -- and human -- banner high and proud. The only way to know for sure is to wait and see.

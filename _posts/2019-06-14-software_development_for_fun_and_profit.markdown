Imagine you were a successful hedge fund VP, but then you vacated the position so you start your own tech company (known as a "dot com" in the days of yore). You did the most important thing they don't teach in school, which is market and industry selection (it's just too *judgemental* to say one thing is better than the other these days). 

Well, good ole Jeff Bezo's looked at 20 different possibilities and chose the one that he thought was most profitable. As a hedge fund manager, he learned the ability to choose based on the potential size of the market. The point is, he didn't make his choice based on the "fun" part of "fun and profit". He chose where the largest leverage could be — books — and started with that. And of course, if you know anything about the history of Amazon, he was willing to play the long game. 

So like Jeff, I'm making a play at the long game. A technology I think could be a ubiquitous part of many, if not most, effective team's future way of engaging with new team members and themselves. I know I am being a bit vague here. But first to market and all that yada yada. I'll reveal more later. But I think I have a perspective to bring to the table that others may be missing. 

As in any successful business, the key is bringing great value to the table. If my software can bring extraordinary value to the market — and I am successful in showing the market that value — the software will sell. 

All off this preamble may give you a clue why I am interested in coding. It's a tool. And not that many people know how to use that tool. Some people estimate only 1/2 of 1% of people know how to code. Others estimate 1/4 of 1%. I suspect it's even less. And this of the dominant and defining force in the modern world. So knowing to code makes one powerful. And if you don't desire power, at least it makes you useful. 

So go out there and code. For fun. For profit.

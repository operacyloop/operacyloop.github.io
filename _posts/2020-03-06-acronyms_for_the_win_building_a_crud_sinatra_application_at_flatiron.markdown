Even before I entered a coding boot camp, I had this idea for creating software that would match teams with people and people with teams. It's been on my mind for a long time, in fact the entire reason I joined the coding Boot Camp it's so that I would have the skills to build such a project.

So when I found out about the second portfolio project and that it would require relationships, it seemed like the type of project that I could use as maybe even a framework for my overall coding goal. 

**Objects **


One of the cool ideas in computing is the idea of Objects. I think about Objects at the way to represent real life things inside the brains of a computer. 

There are so many different types of relationships when it comes to thinking about how teams integrate with people and people integrate with teams, it's almost daunting in terms of what can be done and how it should be done. In this case, in my second portfolio project, I decided to keep things simple. Instead of the many to many relationship, I decided to focus on a one to many relationship. This is something that can be scaled later. In this case I was looking at one user, that person being an HR person someone in human resources. And many were the number of people that person was rating. 

In the big project (outside of coding school) I have much more complexity but because the project is designed to help us understand the basics, I did a much simplified version. All we did was have HR people evaluate different people with one characteristic they were evaluating. So in this case it was tact. However, 
in a more complex program we would look at a number of individuals and a number of different qualities in each individual and we would have a number of different people reading each of those qualities of each other individual.

**MVC: Models-Views-Controllers**

The interesting conventions regarding how programming should go, involves having models views and controllers sometimes called MVC. Models basically deals with the model of the world that we have, usually the robustness is compressed into the confines of  a database. 
The views is what the person at the other end of the browser is looking at. And the controllers controls what goes to views and wicket stored in miles and what comes from miles.

For my project I had users which were essentially HR professionals, and I had posts which ended up being considered the data version of a human being and their rating on tact. I had an application for controller but also I have other controllers which the functionality of the application controller flowed from which. So I had a post controller at the sessions controller. 

**CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete **

In the posts someone was allowed to create their own post they were allowed to edit their post, they were allowed to see the other post from the other HR professionals, and they were also able to delete their own post. They were not allowed to change anybody else's posts. This is all called crud functionality. CRUD is an acronym for the different ways we deal with data. We create, read, update and delete. So my project people were allowed to create a name some notes about an individual plus a rating on tact. Again we're gonna have lots more things to write on each individual in later project. They could read their own and other peoples ratings, as well as edit them a.k.a. update. 
And they could also delete their ratings as well.

**MVP: Minimal Viable Product**

Are the key things to learn in Cody school but also in business as well as life is that sometimes it's OK to not have a perfect product. Including it's called a Minimal Viable Product, an MVP. A minimal viable product only needs to fulfill the basic requirements. It does not need any bells and whistle's. Would you believe that the original Airbnb basically only had listings on each side and people had to make the connections them selves, nothing was automated? It was very minimal. But it was viable. I definitely had to change my own grandiose designs on world domination for my project. However I did get to a place where I I'm a program working. It may have been ugly but we got it working! It'll be the framework for my future project even if I didn't complete something that was much larger as I hoped for. So keep that in mind for your project. Get the minimum requirements done and then you can build on it.

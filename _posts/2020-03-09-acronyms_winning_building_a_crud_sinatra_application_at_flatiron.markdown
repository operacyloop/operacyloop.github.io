Even before I entered a coding boot camp, I had this idea for creating software that would match teams with people and people with teams. It's been on my mind for a long time. In fact, the entire reason I joined the coding boot camp it's so that I could obtain the skills to build such a project.

So when I found out that the second portfolio project at my boot camp was one that might eventually provide the framework for my larger more complex project, I became very excited. 

One of the cool ideas in modern computing is the idea of Objects. I think about Objects at the way to represent real life things inside the brains of a computer. 

There are so many different types of relationships when it comes to thinking about how teams integrate with people and people integrate with teams, it's almost daunting in terms of what can be done and how it should be done. In this case, in my second portfolio project, I decided to keep things simple. Instead of a many to many relationship, I decided to focus on a one to many relationship. This is something that can be scaled later. In this case, I was looking at one user, perhaps an HR professional (someone in human resources) or a third-party recruiter. And for "many" are the number of people that person was rating. 

In my aspirational big project (outside of coding school) there would be much more complexity, but because the project is designed to help us understand the basics. So I ended up doing a much more simplified version. All we did was have HR people evaluate different people with one characteristic they were evaluating. In the bigger project there would be many more characteristics. In this portfolio project, all we looked at was "tact".

However, in a more complex program we would look at a number of individuals and a number of different qualities in each individual and we would have a number of different people evaluating each of those qualities of each other individuals.

So there were a couple of acronyms to know and think about in this project. Here they are:

**MVC: Models-Views-Controllers**

The interesting conventions regarding how programming should go, involves having models views and controllers sometimes called MVC. Models basically deals with the model of the world that we have, usually the robustness is compressed into the confines of  a database. 
The views is what the person at the other end of the browser is looking at. And the controllers controls what goes to views and wicket stored in miles and what comes from miles.

For my project I had users which were essentially HR professionals, and I had posts which ended up being considered the data version of a human being and their rating on tact. I had an application for controller but also I have other controllers which the functionality of the application controller flowed from which. So I had a post controller at the sessions controller. 

**CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete **

In many projects it's important there is CRUD. CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, Delete -- the different ways we deal with data. A blog or an online journal would be a good example. A user is allowed to create their own post, they are allowed to edit their post, they are allowed to read their posts (and perhaps see the other posts), and they are also able to delete their own post. They were not allowed to change anybody else's posts. This is all called CRUD functionality (But why CRUD? Why couldn't it have been CURD? I think CURD is better than CRUD. Just sayin'). 

We create, read, update and delete. So in my project people were allowed to create a name of an individual to be rated, leave some notes about that individual, plus a rate that person on one characteristic: tact. Again, we're gonna have lots more characteristics to wrate on each person in a later project. 

**MVP: Minimal Viable Product**

One of the key things to learn in coding school, but also in business (and perhaps life in general) is that sometimes it's OK to not have a perfect product. The way we say that in the software realm is by naming it a "Minimal Viable Product", an MVP. A Minimal Viable Product only needs to fulfill the basic requirements. It does not need any bells and whistles. Would you believe that the original Airbnb app only had home listings and people listings, and people had to pay directly? Very little if anything was automated. Although it was minimal, it was viable. I definitely had to change my own grandiose plans for world domination for this portfolio project. However I did get to a place where my program was working. It may have been ugly but we got it going! And it'll be the framework for my future project, even if I didn't end up being something much larger as I hoped for. So keep that in mind for *your* project. Get the minimum requirements done *first* and then you can build on it.

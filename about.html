<p>"B to the I to the S" decided to forgo the main attractant for coding boot camp ⁠— career upgrade and job placement ⁠— and instead use the coding classroom as a testbed for software designed to take over the world [with usefulness].

"B to the I to the S" co-owns two small businesses in Washington, DC. </p>
